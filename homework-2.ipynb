    "# Homework 2: What do the SARS-Cov-2 genes do?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first homework, we wrote an algorithm to retrieve ORFs from the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Some retrieved ORFs may correspond to the actual genes, some were there by chance, and some because the start codon also encodes for methionine, so the retrieved ORF was a (short) part of the more extended coding sequence. We used protein hydrophobicity to find potential transmembrane proteins. But what about other types of proteins? How can we tell which ORFs correspond to the actual genes?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will answer the question above in the bioinformatics way and lean to what we know about evolution. If two species are morphologically different, their genetic material must also differ substantially. Right? Not exactly. Evolution conserved many genes crucial for survival. The degree of conservation is surprising. For example, while we would expect to share many genes with the chimpanzee, our closest relative, we would expect almost no similarity in our genetic material with bananas. The numbers tell us otherwise. While sharing 96% of our genes with the chimpanzee, we also share 60% of our genes with bananas! These similar genes in humans and bananas encode proteins that carry similar functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two genes with similar sequences may perform similar functions. Genes like these are called homologous genes. Or, more precisely, in our case, these would be orthologous genes (see the figure below). A pair of orthologous genes are genes from two related species originating from a common ancestor (e.g., humans and chimpanzees). Due to the evolution, the two nucleotide or protein sequences might differ slightly but not overwhelmingly.\n",

    "The human-banana example demonstrates that these two organisms don't have to be that closely related! If we tried to determine the gene function in humans using bananas as a reference, we could infer the role of over 60% of the genes. However, using two closely related organisms would undoubtedly give us more robust results. We would be better off choosing the genome of a mouse or a chimpanzee as our reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists have studied hundreds of viruses and determined the functions of most of their genes. Using viruses similar in sequence to SARS-Cov-2, we can characterize the SARS-CoV-2 ORFs we found in our first homework and determine if they are the actual genes, and think about their function. Knowing what each gene does might help us find a way to fight the infection and potentially even find treatments for COVID-19. "

    "## Finding SARS-CoV-2's closest relatives\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this assignment, we will analyze several coronavirus genomes to determine which are most similar to SARS-CoV-2. We will then use the viruses with the most similar sequence as reference genomes to assign functions to SARS-CoV-2 ORFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the closest reference genomes, we will align the SARS-CoV-2 sequence to each candidate coronavirus genome. The virus genomes with the highest alignment scores will be our most closely-related viruses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that computing an alignment between two sequences of length $N$ and $M$ requires the computation of a dynamic programming table with $N \\cdot M$ entries. The size of this matrix is sufficiently small for short sequences. But even the short genomes, like viral genomes, are generally too long for this approach. Instead of computing similarities from the entire genomes, we will only focus on the spike protein sequence. In general, we would prefer to align the whole nucleotide sequences, but for this assignment, considering only a spike protein will be sufficient. The spike protein is also one of the essential parts of any coronavirus, as it is the one that grants the virus entry to host cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering spike proteins alone reduces the sequence lengths from ~30k (entire virus) to around 1.3k (spike protein). Nevertheless, do your best to write fast, efficient Python code. On the laptop of your teaching assistants, each `global_alignment` call on 1.3k long protein sequences takes around 30 to 60 seconds. We have to calculate 20 comparisons, which takes roughly 10 to 20 minutes."

    "In the previous homework, your task was to find ORF candidates, which we then classified into transmembrane/non-transmembrane proteins using a naive approach based on hydrophobicity. A far more sophisticated approach for characterizing any genetic sequence is BLAST. BLAST stores a database of annotated genes (usually from various organisms) and then uses local alignment and heuristic search to find database genes with a similar sequence to a query one. Assuming that genes with similar protein sequences perform similar functions, we can infer the function of a query sequence by looking at the function of any matching genes returned by BLAST. It is also possible that BLAST will not find suitable matches, which may signal that a sequence might not be an actual gene or protein. In this problem, we will implement our simplified BLAST version and call it MiniBLAST. We will use MiniBLAST to determine whether each of our candidate ORFs is a gene. And if it is a gene, we will use the annotations to determine what the gene does.\n",

    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that the coronavirus we've been working with ends with the number 2. That means there must have been a SARS-CoV-1 at some point, right? Indeed there was. The SARS-CoV-1 virus caused a SARS outbreak in 2002-2004 and infected over 8,000 people from 29 countries, killing at least 774 people. These may seem like small numbers today, but at the time, the outbreak caused much panic because the virus had a much higher mortality rate than SARS-CoV-2. \n",

    "Several drugs were developed and tested for the treatment of SARS. Some proved effective. Since SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1, we could repurpose some effective drugs for SARS-CoV-1. We will look at one drug in particular: EK1 binds to a specific region on the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein and prevents the virus from entering the cells, thus stopping the infection and, consequently, the spread of the virus. Assuming the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 is similar enough to the spike protein in SARS-CoV-1, EK1 may be able to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and subsequently stop the infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "EK1 recognizes a specific sequence (or motif) of aminoacid types: **_hpphcpc_** where **_h_** is a hydrophobic, **_p_** is a polar, and **_c_** is a charged amino acid. There are approximately six consecutive repeats of this motif in SARS-CoV-1, so we expect to find a similar pattern in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The individual amino acid types in this motif are not equally important for the successful binding of EK1. For instance, it is much more important for the **_h_** amino acids to be in the correct spots than the **_p_** or **_c_** amino acids. It is also critical that none of the amino acids are missing in the spike protein, as this will prevent binding.\n",

Based on the description of how EK1 binds to the spike protein in the paragraphs above, design a scoring function that will appropriately weigh amino acid matches/mismatches. Then, perform local alignment between the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein sequence and the EK1 target motif (**_hpphcpc_** repeated six times). Since EK1 was developed for SARS-CoV-1, we know there should be a valid binding motif somewhere along the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. Use this fact to calibrate your scoring function. Can we find an EK1 binding motif in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein? Plot the positions of the best alignments in both viruses. For each virus, plot a horizontal line representing the spike protein sequence and a bar indicating the location of the EK1 binding motif.
